# Artificial-Intelligence-Adversarial-Search-Algorithms
Implemented a program to determine the Next Optimized move in a Two  Player Interactive Game by using following Algorithms in Python:

● Greedy Bestfirst Search

● Minimax

● AlphaBeta Pruning

The Player allowed to perform Raid or Sneak Operation.

Developed a Simulation to simulate several battles by applying the above mentioned algorithms as two players.
